    mainText: "I am writing to express my strong interest in applying for the working student position at SRP GmbH. Through my fellow student Nikolaus Häger, I learned that you are looking for goal-oriented working students who can support your team. With my 3 years of professional experience and upcoming graduation, I am convinced that I can be a valuable addition to your team.\n\nAs a computer science student at HTW Berlin with experience at renowned companies such as ImmoScout24 and Deutsche Telekom AG, I bring solid practical knowledge. My expertise includes full-stack development with frontend frameworks like React and Next.js, as well as Spring and Java in the backend. I have experience with cloud services such as AWS, Datadog, and Optimizely, and can independently handle tasks in projects from implementation to release.\n\nMy goal is to systematically develop my existing technical skills and prepare myself for a career as a mid-level developer. As your working student, I can gain further practical experience, familiarize myself with new technologies and workflows, and thus lay the foundations for my professional career after graduation. I would like to work together with experienced team members to expand my competencies and contribute to the company's success.\n\nMy Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science is expected to be completed in the summer semester of 2025. I am enrolled as a student until September 30, 2025, and am flexible for a working student position. Thanks to my comprehensive practical experience, I can independently familiarize myself with new technologies and tasks, so that I can integrate productively into your workflows from the very beginning.\n\nI look forward to contributing my skills at SRP GmbH and developing innovative software solutions together. I would be happy to present my motivation and technical competencies in more detail in a personal interview.",
